# Pan European Raster Algo

This repository contains the code for the Pan European Raster Algo (PERA) project. The PERA project is a collaboration between PEACH (Protection of Environment and Cultural Heritage) and the FIG(Fire Investigacion and Goverance). The project aims to develop a set of algorithms to process raster data in a distributed computing environment. The algorithms are designed to work with large-scale raster datasets, such as those produced by Technosylva and ERICO.
